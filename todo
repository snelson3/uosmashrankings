names like "#1" need to work right
case shouldn't matter at all with aliases

make tio parser not show time in date
validate input
players shouldn't be "ranked" until they have 10 matches
ranked and unranked tournaments
someone should not be in the playerlist unless they have matches right?
Implement whatever features garpr has I don't (think it's just the head to head thing)
I'd like players matches to be separated by tournamnet, w ith an overall rank change displayed at the top
get rid of the "Melee suffix", as well as dlinking the homepage with all the different rankings

Rankings page should only show (B or A rank medals)
profiles need aliases listed and medals
search page
The page that gives a matchup chart of players, (and the ability to select the players)
Write some basic unit test coverage for uorank (including one unit test per medal)

Ideas for Ranking changes
Reset the Gamma at the start of each term
Increase the Gamma for every tournament the player misses (some way to make losses mean more, but not too much)
placeholder icons for medals
Not sure if dropping out should count as a loss (imo it should...)
old matches only count for half or something
